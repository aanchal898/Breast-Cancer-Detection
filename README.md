# Breast-Cancer-Detection
A detection model was built to detect the tissues affected by Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) using 15 variations of  Convolution Neural Network and compared with the state-of-art architectures like, VGG-16 ,VGG-19, ResNet-50, ResNet50V2, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and LeNet-5. Neural Activation Maps and Class Activation Maps were used to understand the localization of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.
